\item[DNA walking Kit] Found this in \textit{Cloning and expression of
    ecdysone receptor...}.
\item[GeneRacer Kit] Found this in \textit{Cloning and expression of
    ecdysone receptor...}.
\item[HMMer] is a software package for Unix that uses a hidden markov
  model to look for homologs. There is something analogous to
  PSI-BLAST called 'jackhammer'.
\item[Lipofectamine 2000] Apparently this is used to transfect HeLa
  cells or other mammalian cells.
\item[Sequniq] this program compiles files containing many sequences
  and collates them, removing the redundant sequences. Useful for
  combining Oases/Trinity assemblers.
\item[Tigriopus japonicus] This is an intertidal copepod. Apparently
  Dae-Sik Hwang's lab apparently has 1x coverage genome at this
  point. I talked to Professor Oba about it and he said he hasn't been
  able to find the genome either.
